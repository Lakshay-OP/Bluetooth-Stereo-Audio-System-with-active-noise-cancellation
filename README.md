# Bluetooth-Stereo-Audio-System-with-active-noise-cancellation
The need for stronger signal-to-noise ratios drives the study of noise cancellation. Signals are stronger without noise, leading to better signal-to-noise ratios.

The project presents the design of a Bluetooth stereo audio system integrated with active noise cancellation (ANC). It utilizes a Class D audio amplifier and Bluetooth technology to connect with mobile devices and transmit audio. The system incorporates the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm to adaptively filter out noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The authors describe the Bluetooth protocol stack, system efficiency, and simulation results using MATLAB. Challenges include phase mismatching and delays in real-time ANC systems due to ADC, DAC, and filter components.
